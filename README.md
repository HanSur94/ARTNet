## Getting Started 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

Installation of Matlab Version R2019b.

## Installing

1. Download the MatLight.
2. Move the downloaded MatLight folder into any directory of your choice.
3. Open Matlab and choose the MatLight directory as the current directory.

## Examples

The CNN in action can be seen here, where random paintings on canvas from the artwork dataset are used and the corresponding artists are identified. The CNN is only fed with the image data itself.
